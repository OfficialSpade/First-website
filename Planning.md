To successfully implement and create the website i'll need to break down the requirements. 

1. Requirements : 
    Page 1 : 
* Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages
* 1 header using H1
* 3 sections of text with H2 headers
* 1 image
    Page 2 : 
* Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages
* HTML form with a minimum of:
    * 1 fieldset
    * 3 inputs
    * 2 text
    * 1 checkbox
    * 1 textarea
* Appropriate labels for the above
* 1 button
    Page 3 : 
* Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages
* 1 header using H1
* 1 ordered or unordered list of links to 5 other websites
    Page 4 : 
* Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages
* 1 header using H1
* 6 images displayed 3 wide and 2 down
* A label for each image
* Clicking on the image opens the * source of that image in a new window. 

2. Breakdown : 
The first step would be to make the navigation bar that links to all 4 pages. 
Then i'll start with the simple elements like headers and links and lists. 
I'll go onto images which are slightly more complex and then finally i'll style and link everything to its proper sources and add finishing touches. 
I'll start with an empty husk, as in the code without the links or anything which would make it take less and time and also easier to deal with. then i'll add the content and finally stylize it.
